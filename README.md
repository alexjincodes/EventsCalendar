# EventsCalendar
This is a personal project I created where you can add/update events you may have on any day.
The project was created using an MVC style using HTML/Javascript/Jquery/Ajax and a built in calendar plug in.

Main files that I have created are:
<ul>
  <li>HomeController</li>
  <li>/Home/Index</li>
  </ul>
